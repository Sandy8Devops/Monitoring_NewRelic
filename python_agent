Once Hosts are identified in Nrelic
2nd step is to add Application in the Nrelic

There are specific Agent 
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/installation/standard-python-agent-install/

step:1
pip install newrelic


step:2
Need to generate Generate the agent configuration file by running the command:
using the licence key

Licene Key for the account is seen in 


Setup a Project

$ sudo apt install python3-virtualenv //setup evn
$ virtualenv -p python3 PythonDevEnv //create virtual env
$ source PythonDevEnv/bin/activate //use env

will change the prompt..
devops@devops:~$ source PythonDevEnv/bin/activate
(PythonDevEnv) devops@devops:~$  

Start.. playting..

Once in the VirtualEnv , install newrelic

(PythonDevEnv) devops@devops:~/Python_Projects$ pip install newrelic

This is the main step
Download the agent configuration file and put it in your application’s root directory.
Need to download the config file and put in in App root

if you have 5 app, need to put that in all 5 app..

Lets create pyApp1 and PyApp2 and put the downloaded file there..
Its an newrelic.ini file , download and copy to your app

download file from local to remote using ssh
--------
$ scp newrelic.ini devops@192.168.1.95:/tmp
devops@192.168.1.95's password: 
newrelic.ini                                                                                               100% 9186     6.2MB/s   00:00    

now, copy the file in PyApp2 and see if app is refelected 

(PythonDevEnv) devops@devops:/tmp$ cp newrelic.ini ~/Python_Projects/PyApp1/



(PythonDevEnv) devops@devops:~/Python_Projects$ ls
PyApp1  PyApp2
(PythonDevEnv) devops@devops:~/Python_Projects$ 

eg:
PyApp1/app1.py , where newrelic.ini is set at PyApp1 as app name 
insside PythonProject/PyApp1 folder..

Finally data is seee in NewRelic..


Important Thinkg
--
App name must match in newrelic.ini and app name
It must be web app, App should be in running state
